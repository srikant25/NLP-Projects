# 🧠 NLP Project: Educational Text Intelligence

This repository contains a comprehensive **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** project focused on automating and enhancing educational content. It consists of the following key modules:

1. ✂️ **Text Summarization**  
2. 📚 **Question Classification Based on Bloom's Taxonomy**  
3. 🧬 **Question Paper Generation using Genetic Algorithm**

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

### ✂️ 1. Text Summarization

Implements extractive and/or abstractive summarization techniques to automatically generate concise summaries from large educational content or lecture notes.

- Libraries: `NLTK`, `spaCy`, `TextRank`, `BERT (optional)`
- Applications: Study notes generation, revision material

---

### 📚 2. Question Classification (Bloom’s Taxonomy)

This module classifies questions based on Bloom's Taxonomy levels such as:
- Remember
- Understand
- Apply
- Analyze
- Evaluate
- Create

- Technique: Text classification using TF-IDF and machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM)
- Dataset: Labeled question bank (custom or public)
- Output: Bloom level tag for each question

---

### 🧬 3. Question Paper Generation (Genetic Algorithm)

Automatically generates question papers based on:
- Desired Bloom level distribution
- Total marks
- Difficulty level
- Diversity of topics

- Algorithm: Genetic Algorithm to select an optimal set of questions
- Fitness Function: Balances coverage, difficulty, and taxonomy alignment

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- NLTK, spaCy
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Flask (optional for web interface)
